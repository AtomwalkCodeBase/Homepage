Additionally, the company can specify whether the category is excluded from expense claims and if a bill is required for submission.Once the service category is set up, the company can add specific Expense Items or Services (e.g., Consultancy) with details like Name, Service Code, Service Category (linked to the previously defined category), Service Cost, and Description. Employees can then select these predefined expense items when submitting claims.This setup not only simplifies the expense claim process but also aids in project cost analysis, making it a valuable tool for the company's financial management and decision-making.`,
