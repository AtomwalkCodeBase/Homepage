                "As AI and ERP continue to evolve, blockchain technology is expected to play a crucial role in enhancing security and transparency. Blockchain ensures that data integrity is maintained across the system, preventing unauthorized access and reducing fraud risks. For example, a blockchain-powered ERP system in supply chain management can provide a transparent and tamper-proof record of every transaction. This makes it easier for businesses to track products, verify authenticity, and ensure compliance with regulations."
